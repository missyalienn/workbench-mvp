    "How the OpenAI Embeddings API Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- The API accepts either a single string or a list of strings.\n",
    "- For multiple items, you extract the \"text\" field from each item into a list.\n",
    "- Mental model example: [item[\"text\"] for item in items]\n",
    "- Pass that list to the API as input.\n",
    "- The API returns one embedding per item, in the same order as the input list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaway**  Step 2 is really just: convert your items into a list of text strings so the API can embed them all at once.- \n"
