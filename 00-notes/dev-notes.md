# Dev Notes

A living log of commands, tricks, and lessons learned while building this project.

---

## ðŸ§ª Pytest
- `pytest tests/test_auth.py` â€” run all tests in file
- `pytest tests/test_auth.py::test_reddit_auth` â€” run a single test
- `pytest -k test_name` â€” run tests matching substring
- `pytest -x` â€” stop after first failure
- `pytest --maxfail=2` â€” stop after 2 failures
- `pytest -v` â€” verbose output

---

## ðŸ”‘ Auth & Secrets
- Store API keys in macOS Keychain with `keyring`
- Retrieve in Python:  
  ```python
  import keyring
  keyring.get_password("service", "username")

## ðŸ“š Tests Lessons 
- Cursorâ€™s generated tests = scaffolding, not real unit tests
- Refactoring into pytest style makes tests shorter, clearer, and maintainable
